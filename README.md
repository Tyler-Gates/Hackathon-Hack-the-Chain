# Hackathon-Hack-the-Chain
A hackathon project hosted by Major League Hacking (MLH) May 16-17


**Hackcoin**
The goal of this project is to tackle unfamiliar tools and concepts and tie them to crypto as a learning experience!

**Summary**: Create a website that uses ethereum's erc-20 token. This tokens usecase would be to award tokens
to winners and participants in hackathons so they can later be redeemed for cool MLH swag! The goal is to create a participant 
interface and an admin interface within the website whos domain is 'hackcoin.tech' it will be up for a year starting 
the 16th of May.

In order to run: Install Flask, sqlite3, and Python3. Then create a virtual environment and run the files.

**8am recap**: This has been a big learning experience with Python. I have never used Python before. Sadly, with the time crunch I wasnt able to get what I wanted done by myself. I was able to create functionality on the website, creating valid login creditentials "user:admin pass:admin" that rerouted to a page that could only be accessed by a logged in user, in this case the admin. I learned how to upload and use images as well as create a proper login screen, including a flash text for when you log in/out. I wasn't able to figure out how to get the web app I created onto the google cloud service, none of the mentors knew how to either. But I still feel very satisfied with the project.
